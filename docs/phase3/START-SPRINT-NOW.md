# 📢 KIRO - NEW SPRINT INSTRUCTIONS

**From:** Project Manager  
**To:** Kiro (AI Agent)  
**Date:** November 2, 2025, 8:00 PM WIB  
**Status:** 🚀 START IMMEDIATELY  

---

## **CRITICAL: Read This FIRST**

### ⚡ THREE RULES (Non-Negotiable)

1. **NO COMMIT TO GITHUB**
   - Don't commit automatically
   - Wait for owner's "COMMIT NOW" instruction
   - Owner will test browser FIRST, then approve

2. **AUTO-CONTINUE (Save Credits)**
   - Task 1 done? → Auto-start Task 2 (no waiting)
   - Task 2 done? → Auto-start Task 3 (no waiting)
   - Keep going task-by-task WITHOUT recap unless blocked
   - This saves time & credits

3. **RECAP ONLY WHEN ASKED & PROVEN**
   - NO daily reports/recap unless owner asks
   - NO claim "task done" until tested in real browser by owner
   - RECAP = Screenshot/video proof ONLY

---

## **YOUR MISSION THIS WEEK**

Build **real browser experience:**
- Owner opens browser → sees real Shopee products
- Owner clicks sync button → sees feedback (success/error)
- Owner UNDERSTANDS what happened (no logs needed)
- Owner can test 10 products themselves

---

## **7 TASKS - AUTO-CONTINUE**

| Task | What | Evidence |
|------|------|----------|
| 1 | Dashboard shows real products from DB (no dummy) | Browser shows product list |
| 2 | Sync button works, feedback appears in UI | Toast notification works |
| 3 | Status column updates after sync | Shows "synced" + timestamp |
| 4 | Progress bar + log viewer show what's happening | Can see real-time events |
| 5 | Error messages are clear (not technical) | Error toast shows helpful message |
| 6 | Manual batch test: sync 10 products, verify in Shopee | Screenshot proof in both places |
| 7 | Code audit: verify all real, browser-testable | No dummy code, no hallucinations |

---

## **WORKFLOW**

```
✅ Task 1 verified in browser
  ↓
🚀 Auto-start Task 2 (no waiting)
  ↓
✅ Task 2 verified in browser
  ↓
🚀 Auto-start Task 3 (no waiting)
  ↓
... repeat until Task 7
  ↓
⏹️ STOP - Wait for owner instruction
```

---

## **SEND STATUS ONLY WHEN:**
- Task complete & owner can test in browser
- Owner explicitly asks "What's the status?"
- Blocked/error needs owner decision

**Format:**
```
✅ TASK X COMPLETE

What Works:
- [Feature] tested in browser ✓
- [Feature] shows real data ✓

Next: Starting TASK Y
```

---

## **IMPORTANT REMINDERS**

- ✅ All code is REAL (not dummy/mock)
- ✅ All features testable in actual browser
- ✅ All errors clear (owner understands from UI)
- ✅ No technical jargon in user messages
- ✅ Auto-continue = momentum + credit savings
- ✅ NO recap unless asked
- ✅ NO commit until owner approves

---

## **GO**

**Start with:** TASK 1 - Dashboard Product List

**Verify:** Browser shows real products (not dummy)

**Then:** Auto-continue to TASK 2 (don't wait)

**Stop:** When blocked or Task 7 complete
